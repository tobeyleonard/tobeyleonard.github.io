About me
======
Hiya! I'm a doctoral student at Nanjing University, China, currently majoring in Optics and Photonics at [Dielectric Superlattice Lab.](http://slab.nju.edu.cn/)  led by Prof. [Shining Zhu](https://physics.nju.edu.cn/sz/jcrc/zgkxyys/20210111/i184703.html) and advised by Prof. [Shuming Wang](https://physics.nju.edu.cn/sz/gdkxx/20191105/i45277.html).


<p align = "justify">My research interests mainly focus on Nanophotonics, specifically, to investigate the physical mechanism and optical singularities in metamaterials, metasurfaces, bound state in the continuum (BIC) and topological photonics for versatile nano-devices design and advanced imaging. In parallel, I work on optical manipulation based on flat nano-optic elements with Dr. Xiaohao Xu (Jinan Univ., Guangzhou) and Prof. Shaohui Yan (XIOPM, CAS), pursuing something new in classic and quantum physics.</p>

<p align = "justify">Also, I've previously participated in different research areas with Prof. Houjun LÃ¼ (Guangxi Univ.) on High Energy Astrophysics and with Prof. Xuemin Zhang (Wuhan Univ.) on optical instruments development as well as precise alignment of interferometers.</p>

<p align = "justify">I'm honored to be selected as an 'Outstanding Speaker' in 2nd National Academic Forum on Photonics Technology and awarded Second Prize of Presentation Contest in the 1st 'Light & Future' National Graduate Academic Forum.</p>

<p align = "justify">Optical tweezers (OT) and optical spanner (OS) are powerful tools of optical manipulation, which are responsible for particle trapping and rotation, respectively. Conventionally, the OT and OS are built using bulky three-dimensional devices, such as microscope objectives and spatial light modulators. Recently, metasurfaces are proposed for setting up them on a microscale platform, which greatly miniaturizing the systems. In this topic, we offer a metasurface-based solution to integrating the OT and OS. Using the prevailing approach based on the geometric and dynamic phases, we show that it is possible to construct an output field, which promises a high NA focal spot, accompanied with a coaxial vortex. Optical trapping and rotation are numerically demonstrated by estimating the mechanical effects on a particle probe. Moreover, we demonstrate an on-demand control of the OT-to-OS distance and the topological charge possessed by the OS. Our results may empower advanced applications in on-chip particle manipulation.</p>

 <img width="200" align="left"   hspace= 10px src="../images/multidimentional light-field manipulation.png"/>
<p align = "justify">Metasurfaces possessing the advantages of miniaturized size, are widely employed to manipulate light in the subwavelength region, which breaks the limitation of bulky and complex volume and system compared to the traditional optical elements. An advantage of metasurfaces is their versatility by invoking the parameters of light-field to achieve various functionalities into a single-layer metasurface. In this project, we report methods of using the polarization and dispersion of light to achieve multifunctional metasurface devices, allowing the different degrees of freedom of light to carry independent phase profiles to achieve the polarization-dependent conversion of Bessel beams with different orders and NAs as well as wavelength-controlled multifunctional metalenses by introducing an improved genetic algorithm have been implemented. We envision our research are expected to be the potential candidates in multifunctional integrated optical devices.</p>

<div style="font-size:11pt ;  font-style:italic">
 <img width="200" align="left"  hspace= 10px  src="../images/chromatic dispersion manipulation.png"/>
<p align = "justify">Among all the optical elements, metalenses possess the most basic and important applications. Compared with the traditional lenses, it has significant advantages in integration and miniaturization. However, the resonant dispersion of each nanostructure, the inherent dispersion of planar devices and optical materials lead to large chromatic aberrations in the metalenses, that severely reduces the quality of their focusing and imaging. Therefore, how to effectively suppress or manipulate the chromatic aberration of metalenses has attracted worldwide attention in recent years, and various excellent achievements have promoted the development of this field. In this project, the Differencial-phase equation has been employed to design the achromatic or super chromatic metalenses, which provides the possibility for the development of ultrathin full-color camera or spectral imaging devices.</p>

<div style="font-size:12pt"><strong>Fast Support Reduction</strong></div>
</div>
<div style="font-size:10pt"> In layer-based 3D fabrication, supporting structures are fabricated
to support overhanging regions yet discarded later. Reducing supports
saves both time and material cost. In this project, we propose 
a real-time skinning-based method to slim down the
supporting structure while maintaining a detailed-preserved and semantically meaningful geometry.
We achieve this by optimizing a set of performance objectives and searching globally in
the subspace spanned by the joint handles. Artifacts e.g. self-intersection can be effectively avoided.
Our method is implemented via OpenGL shaders and has potential to be
employed as a structural prototyping tool that facilitates model design and fabrication. </div>
