About me
======
Hi! I'm a doctoral student at Nanjing University, China, currently majoring in Optics and Photonics at [Dielectric Superlattice Lab.](http://slab.nju.edu.cn/)  led by Prof. [Shining Zhu](https://physics.nju.edu.cn/sz/jcrc/zgkxyys/20210111/i184703.html) and advised by Prof. [Shuming Wang](https://physics.nju.edu.cn/sz/gdkxx/20191105/i45277.html).


<p align = "justify">My research interests mainly focus on Nanophotonics, specifically, to investigate the physical mechanism and optical singularities that approach to the fundamental limit of light-matter interaction, pursuing something new in light-field manipulation, topological photonics and optomechanics. Parallelly, I also work on developing versatile nano-devices design in the on-chip platform and fibre system for optical tweezers, communications and imaging. </p>

<p align = "justify">I'm honored to be selected as an 'Outstanding Speaker' in 2nd National Academic Forum on Photonics Technology and awarded Second Prize of Presentation Contest in the 1st 'Light & Future' National Graduate Academic Forum.</p>

<p align = "justify">Light-field carries physical information such as wavelength, polarization and phase, etc. When these parameters in the continumm become discontinuous, the cutoff point named the optical singularity. Among them, we are interested in the phase singularity carried by the vortex field and the polarization singularity stemmed from the recently popular momentum space, and hence we investigate the physical mechanism of the singularity within the light field.</p>

<p align = "justify">Photonic band is a typical eigenvalue in optical system. Singularity occurs at the degenerate points of more than two energy bands, also known as Dirac point. The eigenvalues around Dirac points enriches physical connotations, such as the accompanying quantum spin Hall effect and quantum valley Hall effect with topological properties. Meanwhile, the photonic structures existing in open or gain-loss systems will split in the complex plane, and its non-Hermitian Hamiltonian  has also aroused our interest, aiming to find the connections between these eigenvalues.</p>

<p align = "justify">Optical tweezers (OT) and optical spanner (OS) are powerful tools of optical manipulation, which are responsible for particle trapping and rotation, respectively. Conventionally, the OT and OS are built using bulky three-dimensional devices, such as microscope objectives and spatial light modulators. Recently, metasurfaces are proposed for setting up them on a microscale platform, which greatly miniaturizing the systems. In this topic, we offer a metasurface-based solution to integrating the OT and OS. Using the prevailing approach based on the geometric and dynamic phases, we show that it is possible to construct an output field, which promises a high NA focal spot, accompanied with a coaxial vortex. Optical trapping and rotation are numerically demonstrated by estimating the mechanical effects on a particle probe. Moreover, we demonstrate an on-demand control of the OT-to-OS distance and the topological charge possessed by the OS. Our results may empower advanced applications in on-chip particle manipulation.</p>

<p align = "justify">Optical transmission plays an important role in communication and imaging. Although optical fiber possess the abilities of lossless and low cost, it is difficult to operate separately because of its small size and limited mode utilization. We have jointly developed some devices based on cross section of the end of fiber, which can adjust and control the fiber mode, further simplifying the size of devices after mode separation, and saving space costs for increasing communication channels and ultracompact imaging devices.</p>

</div>
<div style="font-size:10pt"> In layer-based 3D fabrication, supporting structures are fabricated
to support overhanging regions yet discarded later. Reducing supports
saves both time and material cost. In this project, we propose 
a real-time skinning-based method to slim down the
supporting structure while maintaining a detailed-preserved and semantically meaningful geometry.
We achieve this by optimizing a set of performance objectives and searching globally in
the subspace spanned by the joint handles. Artifacts e.g. self-intersection can be effectively avoided.
Our method is implemented via OpenGL shaders and has potential to be
employed as a structural prototyping tool that facilitates model design and fabrication. </div>
